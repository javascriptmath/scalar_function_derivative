# Sclar Function Derivative Calculator Webpage

## Overview
This project is a minimalist, single-page web application designed to calculate and display the numerical and analytical derivatives of a simple scalar function, specifically \(f(x) = x^3\). The webpage features a modern dark theme, providing a clean and aesthetically pleasing interface.

## Features
- **Numerical Derivative Calculation:** The webpage uses JavaScript to calculate the derivative of the scalar function \(f(x) = x^3\) at a specified point using the finite difference method.
- **Analytical Derivative Display:** It also calculates the analytical derivative of the scalar function for comparison purposes.
- **Styled Interface:** The user interface features a dark theme with a soft black background and contrasting text colors for readability and a modern look.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout and text formatting are kept simple and clear, ensuring readability across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** Provides the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS (Inline Styles):** Applied inline to create a dark-themed interface.
- **JavaScript:** Handles the mathematical computations for both the numerical and analytical derivatives.

## Usage
The webpage automatically calculates and displays the derivatives for the scalar function \(f(x) = x^3\) at \(x = 1.2\). The user does not need to provide any input. The results are shown in a clean, code-like format that is easy to read and understand.

## Potential Enhancements
- **Interactive Input:** Allow users to input different scalar functions and points at which to calculate derivatives.
- **Expanded Functionality:** Include options for higher-order derivatives or integration.
- **Dynamic Styling:** Provide theme-switching capabilities or additional customization options for the interface.
